INFORMATION RESOURCES AND IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT - Green Vive Cafe Project Proposal

Green Vibe Cafe is the response to Cal State Fullerton's ever-increasing demand for
greater variety. Since the inception of time, students have consistently sought out an optimal
location to sip coffee while studying. The primary concern pertains to the scarcity of spaces
available after the customary closing hours of the majority of establishments. Green Vibe Cafe
endeavors to accommodate the majority of students by providing convenient hours, an enticing
menu, and convenient location for those who reside in the heart of the school campus. Due to its
location directly outside the CSUF campus, the business will primarily attract faculty, staff, and
students. The organization's mission is to facilitate the advancement and prospects of individuals
who operate most efficiently in a setting populated by individuals who share similar values and
objectives. Our objective is to furnish a workspace that is conducive to productivity, featuring
essential supplies, beverages, and like-minded individuals who are open to working both
independently and collectively. Annie Xu, Arundhathi Roy, Rewa Garg and Srija Vellanki will
each hold an equal share of the management. Given that every founding member is an active Cal
State Fullerton student, we deem it highly appropriate to unite in order to foster an atmosphere
that promotes personal growth and inspires others to do the same. Green Vibe Cafeâ€™s product is
primarily distinguished by the manner in which we accommodate students in particular:
extended hours, reasonable prices, and an atmosphere that encourages individuals of all types to
concentrate on their education. Although situated directly outside the school campus, the
establishment welcomes all individuals seeking a beverage or a place to hold a meeting.
Second part of the project will be application development.

BUSINESS IDEA

welcoming space for reading and studying. This venture seeks to harmonize the love for coffee
with a commitment to supporting local agriculture. By using locally sourced ingredients, we aim
to offer our customers the freshest and most sustainable products while simultaneously
contributing to the growth of the community. Our wide-ranging menu will cater to a broad
spectrum of tastes, from artisanal coffee and specialty brews to a delectable assortment of
pastries, sandwiches, and health-conscious options. Furthermore, we envision our coffee shop as
a sanctuary for students, professionals, and book enthusiasts, providing a serene and inspiring
environment for reading, studying, and contemplation. This report outlines the essential IT
systems required to support our coffee shop's operations and customer engagement.
